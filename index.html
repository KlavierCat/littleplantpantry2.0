              Little Plant Pantry is a new plant-based zero-waste wholefoods store in Amsterdam opening in January 2019. As a speciality food store with a focus on ethical consumerism and sustainability, we only offer healthy natural plant-based products and try to minimize waste by completely avoiding plastic, selling in bulk and finding compostable alternatives to traditional packaging. Besides stocking all the essentials for a healthy plant-based diet and for living a healthy lifestyle, the store also provides the highest quality handcrafted foods and beverages, baked, pickled, fermented or prepared as meals for taking home, either made by us or selected by us from like minded local artisan producers who meet and share our core values. The range of products sold in the store includes everything from fresh fruit and vegetables, grains and nuts sold loose to beautiful handmade natural cosmetics. Whether you prefer to cook at home following a recipe or pick up ready-made food at the store, we want to make sure that your meal does not only enrich your body but also is good for the environment.
